##Takeaway Challenge
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/adrianw1832/takeaway-challenge.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/adrianw1832/takeaway-challenge)

This project is from the week 2 weekend challenge of the Makers Academy course.
I split it into 3 classes: menu, order and the TwilioAPI class. The
implementation of the code itself was quite simple and obvious but writing the
tests for the twilio service, was harder. Learning how to use mocks properly was
probably the biggest takeaway(pun not intended) of this challenge. Also, as an
aside, it was important to learn not to leave tokens if possible on Github.

##Challenges

This is the first time we encountered and used an API. Setting it up was not
really that difficult. The main difficulty was in creating a valid test and also
mocking the API call so that a text message will not be sent everytime the test
is run. Apart from that, it was pretty ok.

##Technologies used

Ruby

RSpec

##How to install

Clone the repo and run IRB in terminal to play around.

Instructions
-------
* Challenge time: Friday, the entire day + the weekend if you need it
* Feel free to use google, your notes, books, etc but work on your own
* You must submit a pull request to this repo with your code by 9am Monday morning

Task
-----

* Fill out your learning plan self review for the week: https://github.com/makersacademy/learning_plan (if you haven't already)
* Fork this repo
* run the command 'bundle' in the project directory to ensure you have all the gems
* Write a Takeaway program with the following user stories:

```
As a customer
So that I can check if I want to order something
I would like to see a list of dishes with prices

As a customer
So that I can order the meal I want
I would like to be able to select some number of several available dishes

As a customer
So that I can verify that my order is correct
I would like to check that the total I have been given matches the sum of the various dishes in my order

As a customer
So that I am reassured that my order will be delivered on time
I would like to receive a text such as "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52" after I have ordered
```

* Hints on functionality to implement:
  * ensure you have a list of dishes with prices
  * place the order by giving the list of dishes, their quantities and a number that should be the exact total. If the sum is not correct the method should raise an error, otherwise the customer is sent a text saying that the order was placed successfully and that it will be delivered 1 hour from now, e.g. "Thank you! Your order was placed and will be delivered before 18:52".
  * The text sending functionality should be implemented using Twilio API. You'll need to register for it. It’s free.
  * Use the twilio-ruby gem to access the API
  * Use a Gemfile to manage your gems
  * Make sure that your Takeaway is thoroughly tested and that you use mocks and/or stubs, as necessary to not to send texts when your tests are run
  * However, if your Takeaway is loaded into IRB and the order is placed, the text should actually be sent

* Advanced! (have a go if you're feeling adventurous):
  * Implement the ability to place orders via text message.

* A free account on Twilio will only allow you to send texts to "verified" numbers. Use your mobile phone number, don't worry about the customer's mobile phone.
* Finally submit a pull request before Monday at 9am with your solution or partial solution.  However much or little amount of code you wrote please please please submit a pull request before Monday at 9am
